    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition and behaviour of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are</p>
    <p>classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i> Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas(<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>) and oxygen gas(<i>O<sub>2</sub></i>) to form water (<i>H<sub>2</sub>O</i>).
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <dfn>Stoichiometry</dfn> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represents charges or number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry infuences every aspect of our <br>lives. </p>
